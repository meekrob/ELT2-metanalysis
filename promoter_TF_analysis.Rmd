```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(GenomicRanges)
```

## Goal

This analysis is looking for TFs that may explain intestine expression in the absence of ELT-2.

## Promoters

Genes which fall under different classes of intestine enrichment in Williams et al. 2023
are assigned promoters gene 5' -1Kb/200bp. 

The dataset has each promoter in the genome annotated with intestine expression DESeq information, as well as ELT-2 binding status gotten from Kudron et al. 2018.

```{r promoters}
promoters_df = readRDS('DATA/promoter_data.rds')
promoters_df %>% head()
```

### Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
