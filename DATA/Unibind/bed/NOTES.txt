Scripts to organize this directory:
    makelinks.bash - link everything in all/ to a corresponding directory with the developmental stage indicated in the filename. remove that string from the linked filename
    rename_dirs.bash - take out the repeated 'Whole_worms_developmental_stage_' from the dirnames
    fix_links.bash - I forgot to add "../all" in creating the links.
The following takes care of the rest.
     mv Whole_worms_mix_stage_culture mix_stage_culture
     mv Whole_worms_mixed-stage_embryos mixed-stage_embryos
     mv Whole_wormsdevelomental_stage_day_4_young_adult day_4_young_adult
All files are whole worm except :
    Young_adults_germline_tissue
    Young_adults_somatic_cells
